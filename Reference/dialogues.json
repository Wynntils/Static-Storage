Did my friend know what to do?","id":"recoverthepast-caid-15"},{"num":3,"max":5,"speaker":"Caid","line":"A shrinking potion... Weird choice, but I guess it'll work.

I'll get to work immediately- we must know more!","id":"recoverthepast-drpicard-20"},{"num":7,"max":8,"speaker":"Dr. Picard","line":"In the meantime, I'll have you fetch another test subject for me.

Captain Ragon was glad to hear that, I'll tell you.","id":"recoverthepast-tasim-6"},{"num":3,"max":4,"speaker":"Tasim","line":"Me? Eh, nothing really to talk about.

I'll follow you to the doctor.","id":"recoverthepast-scoutreynauld-16"},{"num":6,"max":6,"speaker":"Tasim","line":"Same here! I'm definitely curious to see what I've forgotten.

I just wanted to have a quick chat about your performance.","id":"recoverthepast-royalcaptain-7"},{"num":5,"max":13,"speaker":"Royal Captain","line":"You understand that those of us who serve Her Majesty in such well regarded positions have a certain... strict code of honor we must follow, yes?","id":"recoverthepast-royalcaptain-8"},{"num":6,"max":13,"speaker":"Royal Captain","line":"Otherwise, how could we be certain our ranks are pure of any misdeeds?

Just because I didn't do any proper tests before this doesn't mean it isn't safe! I've done the calculations!

I swear, I was able to see more when I looked at my own memories! It's ridiculous!","id":"recoverthepast-drpicard-31"},{"num":5,"max":11,"speaker":"Dr. Picard","line":"Hmph. Maybe it just needs more power... If I increase the amount of mana I put into the spell, then-","id":"recoverthepast-drpicard-32"},{"num":6,"max":11,"speaker":"Tasim","line":"Hold on. You want to put more magic into this, when it's already unstable?","id":"recoverthepast-tasim-21"},{"num":7,"max":11,"speaker":"Dr. Picard","line":"Yes, fine, I understand you've taken issue with my methodology. But it works! This has worked thrice now!","id":"recoverthepast-drpicard-33"},{"num":8,"max":11,"speaker":"Dr. Picard","line":"Don't you want to know what your life was like before? Even if it's not what you want to see, isn't it better to know?","id":"recoverthepast-drpicard-34"},{"num":9,"max":11,"speaker":"Tasim","line":"...Fine. We can look at my memories.

It's the same deal with white bread.","id":"fantasticvoyage-breadman-58"},{"num":54,"max":99,"speaker":"Jofash Resident","line":"Fruit juice was banned in my household.

Heheh...","id":"fantasticvoyage-breadman-64"},{"num":60,"max":99,"speaker":"Jofash Resident","line":"Right, then, somethin' that really peeves me is people who use bakin' powder. What's wrong with some good ol' yeast?","id":"fantasticvoyage-breadman-65"},{"num":61,"max":99,"speaker":"Jofash Resident","line":"Too little of it, and it'll go plum flat in the oven.

What does he want?","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-74"},{"num":3,"max":5,"speaker":"Ava","line":"[24 Emerald Blocks]? Is that a lot? I'm not human, y'know! Well, anyway!","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-75"},{"num":4,"max":5,"speaker":"Ava","line":"Buy that if you want, but I'm certain there are other ways to obtain an audience.

Keep looking then.","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-77"},{"num":1,"max":6,"speaker":"Ava","line":"Oh? You found the dealer as well as one other way to get an audience?","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-78"},{"num":2,"max":6,"speaker":"Ava","line":"24 Emerald Blocks, huh? No clue if that's a lot. I'd say we should try your other way! What is it?","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-79"},{"num":3,"max":6,"speaker":"Ava","line":"There's a receptionist for audiences? How convenient! We should go talk to her then!","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-80"},{"num":4,"max":6,"speaker":"Ava","line":"It's... Apparently really hard? Oh... Well, that's not helpful.

But keep your head up! We got this!","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-107"},{"num":2,"max":6,"speaker":"Ava","line":"There was a normal way to get an audience which is via a monthly competition of some sort, I think? We, uh... missed it. So that'll have to pass.","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-108"},{"num":3,"max":6,"speaker":"Ava","line":"Now, for other... Unconventional ways...

I honestly don't care about listening to the law anymore.","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-114"},{"num":3,"max":6,"speaker":"Ava","line":"Let's just get that audience. For one, there's some girl panicking by the Armour Merchant! Maybe she could help?","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-115"},{"num":4,"max":6,"speaker":"Ava","line":"As for another way, I don't know if you paid attention on our way to the receptionist, but...","id":"thefeathersflypart2-ava-116"},{"num":5,"max":6,"speaker":"Ava","line":"There is apparently a dealer in there.
